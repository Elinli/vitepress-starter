Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.</li><li><strong>Component-Based:</strong> Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.</li><li><strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere:</strong> We don&#39;t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.</p><p><a href="https://cn.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Learn how to use Vue in your project</a>.</p><h3 id="vite" tabindex="-1">Vite <a class="header-anchor" href="#vite" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><h3 id="ecmascript6" tabindex="-1">ECMAScript6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#ecmascript6" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><h3 id="json-server" tabindex="-1">Json Server <a class="header-anchor" href="#json-server" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><h3 id="algorithm" tabindex="-1">Algorithm <a class="header-anchor" href="#algorithm" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>',15),o=[s];function n(h,l,c,d,u,p){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const v=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
